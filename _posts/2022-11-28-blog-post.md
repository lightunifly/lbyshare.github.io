# Purpose

I write this note to help myself learn and understand statistical physics. Also for using English in academic.

The begin of statiscal physical is *Maximum Entropy* $$S=k_blnW$$.

Let me use Maximum Entropy get Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, Bose-Einstein distribution and Fermi-Dirac distribution.
