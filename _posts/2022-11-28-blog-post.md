# Purpose

I write this note to help myself learn and understand statistical physics. Also for using English in academic.

# Maximum Entropy

The begin of statiscal physical is *Maximum Entropy*
$$S=k_blnW$$

Let me use Maximum Entropy get Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, Bose-Einstein distribution and Fermi-Dirac distribution.

## Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

We consider the model *M* consist of the system *S* and a thermal bath *B*. The total energy $E_t$ and particle numbers $N_t$ in *M* are conserved. But the system *S* and bath *B* can exchange energy and particle with each other.

### Only exchange energy

Let me define the conditions more accurately with mathmatics

$$E_t = E_s + E_b = Const$$
$$W_t = W_s*W_b$$(Assumption of independence between *S* and *B*, but if they have correlation?)

Now we want to maximize $W_t$ and need to point out the relation between the number of microscopic states $W$ and energy $E$.
