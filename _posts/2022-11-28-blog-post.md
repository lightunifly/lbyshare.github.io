# Purpose

I write this note to help myself learn and understand statistical physics. Also for using English in academic.

# Maximum Entropy

The begin of statiscal physical is *Maximum Entropy*
$$S=k_blnW$$

Let me use Maximum Entropy get Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, Bose-Einstein distribution and Fermi-Dirac distribution.

## Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

We consider the model *M* consist of the system *S* and a thermal bath *B*. The total energy and particle numbers in *M* are conserved. But the system *S* and bath *B* can exchange energy and particle with each other.

### Only exchange energy
