# Purpose

I write this note to help myself learn and understand statistical physics. Also for using English in academic.

# Maximum Entropy

The begin of statiscal physical is *Maximum Entropy*. So what is *Maximum Entropy*, or more basicly, what is *Entropy*?

The objects for *Maximum Entropy* can have many *states* ${s_i}$. I write this opinion down

$$S = S(s_1,s_2,\cdots,s_N)$$

So *Maximum Entropy* will give a constraint *F* on the *states* ${s_i}$. But what is the explicit form of the constraint *F* under specific conditions? We must consider the concrete meaning of *states* ${s_i}$ and the explicit form of *Entropy* $S$ on these *states*.

## Microstates and Macrostates

The states can be microstates and also macrostates. When we say they are microstates, that means we can't or needn't find any internal variables or freedoms to divide one microstate into more states. So every microstate has equal weight, that means the possibility of each microstate is equal to $1/N$, where $N$ is the total number of microstates. So we have microstates but why do we need macrostates? Beacause many microstates can have same features and too many microstates is meaningless expect their huge total number $N$. Nothing else we can know. And what we care about are a few important physical variables describing the objects. So can we fetch the information about these physical variables? The answer is just *Maximum Entropy*, or more accurately, following the direction and method by *Maximum Entropy*.

### Example and Shonnon Entropy

We consider the object has three macrostate, and the number of microstates of each macrostate is listed:

|1|2|3|
|5|9|4|

so what is the entropy of the object?

## Thermal Entropy

$$S=k_blnW$$

Let me use Maximum Entropy get Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution, Bose-Einstein distribution and Fermi-Dirac distribution.

## Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution

We consider the model *M* consist of the system *S* and a thermal bath *B*. The total energy $E_t$ and particle numbers $N_t$ in *M* are conserved. But the system *S* and bath *B* can exchange energy and particle with each other.

### Only exchange energy

Let me define the conditions more accurately with mathmatics

$$E_t = E_s + E_b = Const$$
$$W_t = W_s*W_b$$(Assumption of independence between *S* and *B*, but if they have correlation?)

Now we want to maximize $W_t$ and need to point out the relation between the number of microscopic states $W$ and energy $E$.
