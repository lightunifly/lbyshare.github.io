My name is Mincong Wu. And I'm a fourth-year physical PhD student in Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST). My current research area is biophysics, specially about enhanced sampling of protein folding. We use deep learning or some other dimension reduce method to find some collective variables to do enhanced sample and help protein fold into its native state. My advisor is Changjun Chen. Although my first research area is AMO about trapped ions and change the direction and advisor in my second year.

This website is used to collect notes and ideas. I hope this website will be helpful for anyone who comes across here. Any my biggest interest is to thinking and talking about valuable theoretical and philosophical questions.

My current email is mincong_wu@hust.edu.cn. Please feel free to reach out any time.
